Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.\n\nA good practice is to also add message attributes when publishing to SNS. Each SQS subscription can have a filter policy that matches only the messages it cares about, so that only relevant messages are delivered to each SQS queue, and consumers only see/process what they need.\n\nan SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.\n\nIt's important to note that the maximum number of messages per second that a queue can handle is not the same as the maximum number of requests per second that the SQS API can handle. The SQS API is designed to handle a high volume of requests per second, so it can be used to send messages to your queue at a rate that exceeds the maximum message throughput of the queue.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Aurora is a MySQL-compatible relational database engine that provides high performance and scalability. With Multi-AZ deployment, the database is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.\nAurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas based on the workload, ensuring that read requests can be distributed effectively and the database can scale to meet demand. This provides both high availability and automatic scaling to handle unpredictable read workloads.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

For example, you can create metric filters that look for specific keywords or patterns related to RDP or SSH connections.\nCloudWatch Metric Alarm:** Set up CloudWatch metric alarms based on the metric filters.

Migrate the script on the EC2 instance to an AWS Lambda function with the appropriate runtime.\n\nAWS Lambda: Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests.\nCost-Efficiency: With Lambda, you only pay for the compute time consumed during code execution. This can be more cost-effective than running and maintaining an EC2 instance, especially for sporadic or event-driven workloads.\nAutomatic Scaling: Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming events. As the number of messages in the SQS queue grows, Lambda can scale out to handle the increased workload.\nEvent-Driven: Lambda is well-suited for event-driven architectures, making it a good fit for scenarios where messages are added to an SQS queue.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

In the policy, set the instances to pre-launch 30 minutes before the jobs run.\n\nIn general, if you have regular patterns of traffic increases and applications that take a long time to initialize, you should consider using predictive scaling. Predictive scaling can help you scale faster by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load, compared to using only dynamic scaling, which is reactive in nature.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

This helps improve the performance of your application by serving data directly from the cache instead of querying the database every time.\n\nCaching Large Datasets: In scenarios where identical datasets are frequently requested, caching the results in ElastiCache can significantly reduce the load on the database and improve response times for subsequent requests. It is particularly effective for read-heavy workloads where the data does not change frequently.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Add an inbound rule to the security group of the database tier’s RDS instance to allow traffic from the web tiers security group.\n\nSecurity Groups: Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. By default, they deny all inbound traffic. In this scenario, the default security group associated with the RDS instance is likely denying incoming traffic from the web tier.\n\nInbound Rule: To allow traffic from the web tier's EC2 instances to the database tier's RDS instance, you need to add an inbound rule to the security group associated with the RDS instance. This rule should permit traffic from the security group associated with the web tier's EC2 instances.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Create a read replica for the RDS DB instance.\n\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that can improve the performance of a website by caching static content closer to the users. This reduces latency and improves page load times.\nConfigure CloudFront to distribute static content such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files. This will offload the serving of static assets from the web servers, improving overall website performance.\n\nCreating a read replica for the Amazon RDS database allows you to offload read traffic from the primary database, improving the overall database performance.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Use EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer to read from the SQS queue and process orders into the database.\n\nAmazon SQS, which is a fully managed message queuing service. Writing orders to an SQS queue allows for decoupling the EC2 instances processing the orders from the application writing the orders. EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group can then read from the SQS queue, ensuring that the processing scales with demand.\n\nUsing an Auto Scaling group ensures that you can dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the workload. This can help handle high traffic efficiently.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
